I'd like to continue working on my dotfiles repository. Let's make sure you have all the context from our previous sessions by reviewing a few key files:

1. First review the CLAUDE.md in the root directory for overall context.
2. Look at the install.sh script to understand the recent changes we made to eliminate the stow dependency and add smarter detection.
3. Check zsh/CLAUDE.md to understand the zsh configuration structure and installation approach.
4. Look at the zsh/local.zsh.example to understand how we handle private tokens.

In our last session, we completely rebuilt the installation system to remove external dependencies, added smart detection for already-installed configurations, improved support for zsh configuration, and added better handling for Doom Emacs detection.

Let's continue improving the dotfiles by looking at:
1. The emacs configuration to see if any improvements are needed there
2. Potential enhancements to the zsh prompt functionality
3. Additional features we could add to make the dotfiles more portable
