# dotfiles - Current Session State

**Ephemeral handoff - what's happening RIGHT NOW**

---

## Current State (Oct 20, 2025 - 12:00 PM EDT)

**Branch:** master
**Status:** Clean working tree (all changes committed)
**Recent commits:**
- 9204067 - Add Memory Protocol and protocol evolution to Claude configuration
- 1c2c4a9 - Migrate to Memory Protocol (MEMORY.md + NOW.md)

---

## What We Just Shipped

**Session achievements:**
1. ✅ Committed protocol enhancements to claude/CLAUDE.md
   - Protocol Evolution (self-improving behavioral strata)
   - Designing Protocols (meta-rules)
   - Plan Mode Protocol (concise, scannable planning)
   - Memory Protocol (three-file pattern documented)
   - Code Session Architecture (composable behaviors)

2. ✅ Successfully migrated to Memory Protocol
   - Created MEMORY.md (intelligence archive)
   - Created NOW.md (ephemeral state)
   - Deleted legacy NEXT_SESSION.md
   - Repository now uses the protocols it documents (dogfooding)

**Pattern demonstrated:** Migration workflow (commit → extract → create → delete)

---

## Immediate Next Action

**Repository is stable and ready for new work.**

**Suggested focus areas:**

1. **Emacs configuration improvements**
   - File: `emacs/config.org`
   - Review current org-mode setup
   - Consider additional packages or optimizations
   - Check for any pain points in current config

2. **ZSH prompt enhancements**
   - File: `zsh/.zshrc` or relevant prompt files
   - Review git integration
   - Check performance
   - Consider additional features

3. **Portability improvements**
   - File: `install.sh`
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Additional platform detection
   - Installation enhancements

4. **Or explore something entirely new**
   - Review open GitHub issues (#9-#17)
   - New utilities for bin/
   - Documentation improvements

**START HERE:** Choose any focus area above, or start fresh exploration.

## Files to Read on Wake

- `MEMORY.md` - Intelligence archive (migration pattern now documented)
- `claude/CLAUDE.md` - Full protocol documentation
- `install.sh` - Current installation system (if working on portability)
- `emacs/config.org` - Emacs configuration (if working on Emacs)
- `zsh/` directory - ZSH configuration (if working on shell)

---

## Blockers

None currently. Repository is clean and ready for new work.

---

## Context & Decisions

**Why we migrated to Memory Protocol now:**
- Repository already documented the protocol
- Should use what it documents (dogfooding principle)
- Clean demonstration for other projects
- NEXT_SESSION.md had accumulated good intelligence worth preserving

**Migration approach:**
- Commit existing work first (separation of concerns)
- Extract all intelligence to MEMORY.md (preserve learnings)
- Create lean NOW.md (current state only)
- Single migration commit (clean history)

**This session validated:**
- Memory Protocol migration is straightforward
- Organic structure > rigid templates
- Dogfooding protocols = strong validation
- Clean git history tells the story

---

## Documentation Updates

**Completed this session:**
- ✅ claude/CLAUDE.md - Added comprehensive protocol documentation
- ✅ MEMORY.md - Created with all historical intelligence
- ✅ NOW.md - This file (current state)

**No additional updates needed.**

---

**This file gets overwritten each /close-code**
**Intelligence goes to MEMORY.md (grows forever)**
**Current state stays here (ephemeral)**

---

**Next wake:** `/wake-code` will load:
- MEMORY.md for patterns and intelligence
- NOW.md (this file) for current state
- Git status for actual changes
- Choose focus area or explore freely
