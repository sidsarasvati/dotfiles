## Case Study 1: Home Office Rent Catch-Up (Oct 30, 2025)

### Situation
- Sid moved to 899 Congress St in March 2025
- Paid home office rent: Mar, Apr, May ($15K total)
- Need to catch up: Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep ($20K total)

### Execution

**1. Review documentation:**
- Home office agreement exists: `/projects/rai-ceo/finance/home-office-2025.md`
- Calculation justified: 2 rooms dedicated (Sid + Saie) = 60% of $8,380 = $5K/mo
- Supporting evidence: Photos, Saie on payroll

**2. Calculate catch-up:**
- June 2025: $5,000
- July 2025: $5,000
- August 2025: $5,000
- September 2025: $5,000
- **Total:** $20,000

**3. Execute Mercury payment request:**
- From personal Mercury: Create payment request
- To: Trial & Error, Inc
- Amount: $20,000
- Request notes: "Office space rental for june, july, august, september 2025"
- Business account: Approve request
- Mercury marks PAID

**4. Update records:**
- Screenshot PAID status
- Save payment request link
- Update Mercury transfer log
- Update home office agreement (payment schedule section)

**5. Remaining 2025:**
- October: Consider Augusta Rule instead (Diwali retreat = 14-day rental)
- November: $5,000 (regular home office)
- December: $5,000 (regular home office)

**Total 2025:** $60,000 (if Oct = regular) or $59,000 (if Oct = Augusta Rule @ $4K)

## Case Study 2: IRS Notice 2030 - Apple 1099-K Timing Issue

### The Problem
**Notice received:** Oct 2025
- **Issue:** Tax year 2023 underreporting claim
- **IRS Claim:** $244K "unreported" income
- **Reality:** Cash vs accrual timing mismatch
- **Deadline:** Nov 6, 2025

### Root Cause Analysis
- Apple reports revenue on **accrual basis** (when earned)
- T&E files on **cash basis** (when received)
- Apple has 45-60 day payment lag
- November-December 2023 earnings paid January-February 2024
- All $244K was properly reported on 2024 return

### Resolution Strategy

**1. Gather Evidence:**
- All Apple 1099-K forms (US, International, Canada)
- Apple monthly financial reports (showing payment lag)
- Bank statements (both 2023 and 2024)
- 2023 and 2024 tax returns

**2. Build Reconciliation:**
Created month-by-month table proving:
- What Apple reported (accrual)
- When cash hit bank (cash basis)
- Which tax year cash was reported

**3. Draft Response (Form 15113):**
Explained:
- T&E uses cash basis (IRS-approved)
- Apple uses accrual basis
- 45-60 day payment lag causes year-end mismatch
- All revenue properly reported (just in 2024 instead of 2023)

**4. Submit Evidence:**
- Bank statements (both years)
- Apple financial reports
- Reconciliation table
- Both tax returns
- Mailed certified (return receipt)

### Outcome
- IRS accepted explanation
- Case closed, $0 owed
- 4-8 weeks resolution time

### Prevention
Next year, include note with return explaining cash basis timing difference

- October 2025: Augusta Rule = $4,000 (instead of regular $5,000)
- November-December 2025: $5,000/month home office = $10,000
- **Total 2025 deduction:** $59,000 ($55K home office + $4K Augusta Rule)

## Case Study 4: Solo 401k Rollover Strategy

### The Problem
- Previous 401k at Guideline (acquired by Gusto)
- 0% returns while Bitcoin +150% YTD in 2025
- No crypto trading access
- Forced to choose: Consent to Gusto or rollover

### The Decision
**Oct 26, 2025 deadline:** Did not consent
**Result:** Forced rollover (exactly what we wanted!)

### Target: MySolo401k
- **Setup cost:** $525
- **Contribution limit:** $70K/year (2025)
- **Investment access:** Direct Bitcoin + MSTR stock trading
- **Allocation plan:** 50% Bitcoin, 30% MSTR, 20% cash

### Why Solo 401k > IRA
- IRA contribution: $7K/year maximum
- Solo 401k contribution: $70K/year maximum
- 10x larger tax-advantaged Bitcoin accumulation
- **Don't convert to IRA** - keep 401k structure

### Tax Benefits
- $70K/year pre-tax contribution
- Tax-deferred Bitcoin growth
- No capital gains on trades within account
- Distributions taxed as ordinary income (in retirement)

### Action Needed
- Verify rollover completed
- Confirm MySolo401k account established
- Begin crypto trading capability
- Set up automatic contributions ($70K/year schedule)

## Case Study 5: Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Strategy (In Progress)

### Current State
- Personal Bitcoin: $3M (85% of $3.5M portfolio)
- Corporate cash: $120K-$200K (T&E treasury)
- Opportunity: Tax-efficient corporate Bitcoin purchases

### The Problem
If Sid takes distribution to buy Bitcoin personally:
1. Distribution taxed as income (~40% tax rate)
2. Take $100K distribution → Pay $40K tax → Only $60K to invest
3. Double taxation problem

### The Solution
Corporate direct Bitcoin purchase:
1. T&E buys Bitcoin directly ($120K-$200K deployment)
2. No distribution tax (stays in corporation)
3. Full $120K invested (vs $60K after personal tax)
4. 2x effective buying power

### MicroStrategy Model
- Aggressive Bitcoin treasury accumulation
- Regular purchases (vs waiting for lump sum)
- Corporate treasury = Bitcoin treasury
- "Make profits → Buy Bitcoin" philosophy

### Wealth Advisor Questions (Morgan Stanley - Vassil)
- Corporate Bitcoin purchase tax treatment?
- Custody solutions for corporate Bitcoin?
- Private markets access for $120K-$200K?
- Tax-efficient structures?

### Next Steps
1. Morgan Stanley consultation (email sent Oct 28)
2. Establish custody solution
3. Begin regular Bitcoin purchases
4. Track as corporate asset
5. Document for CPA (Brad) year-end

### Expected Outcome
- $120K-$200K deployed tax-efficiently
- Corporate Bitcoin position established
- Regular purchase cadence (monthly or quarterly)
- Foundation for larger treasury strategy

## Key Lessons Across All Cases

### What Works
1. **Documentation is everything** - photos, agreements, payment links
2. **Payment requests > transfers** - creates formal audit trail
3. **Conservative rates** - defensible > maximum savings
4. **Evidence-based IRS responses** - bank statements + reconciliation = case closed
5. **Strategic timing** - Augusta Rule + home office stack perfectly

### Common Patterns
- Cash vs accrual timing causes most 1099-K issues
- 45-60 day payment lags = year-end mismatches
- IRS accepts evidence when properly documented
- Corporate structures create tax efficiency
- Payment request method adds professional separation

### Red Flags Avoided
- No round numbers (exact calculations)
- No 100% business use claims
- Clear business purpose (not sham transactions)
- Market-rate pricing (defensible amounts)
- Professional documentation (not casual notes)
