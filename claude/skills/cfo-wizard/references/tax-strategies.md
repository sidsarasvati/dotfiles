## Home Office Deduction (IRC Section 280A)

### Current Setup (2025)
- **Property:** 899 Congress St, Boston MA (moved March 2025)
- **Total rent:** $8,380/month
- **Business use:** 2 dedicated rooms (Sid's office + Saie's office) = ~60%
- **Monthly business rent:** $5,000
- **Annual deduction:** $60,000

### Documentation Needed
- Room calculation (square footage or room count)
- Photos (office setup, equipment)
- Employee evidence (Saie on payroll working from home)
- Exclusive use proof (dedicated workspaces)

## Augusta Rule (IRC Section 280A(g))

### The Strategy
- Rent personal home to business ≤ 14 days/year
- **Rental income = TAX-FREE** (not reported on personal return)
- Business deducts full rental expense
- Named after Augusta National Golf Club (PGA Masters rentals)

### Requirements
1. **Business purpose:** Genuine meeting/retreat (not sham)
2. **Documentation:** Agenda, attendees, business objectives
3. **Reasonable rate:** Market-comparable or below
4. **14-day maximum:** Cannot exceed per year

### Rate Calculation
- **Conservative:** Pro-rata monthly rent (e.g., $8,380 ÷ 30 × 14 = $3,910)
- **Market-based:** Comparable venue costs (hotels, meeting spaces)
- **Premium:** Above monthly rent if justified (intensive use, amenities)

### Documentation Checklist
- Event agenda (specific business sessions)
- Attendee list (names, roles, dates present)
- Business purpose memo (strategic objectives)
- Rental agreement (this is one-time event, not ongoing)
- Payment record (Mercury transfer with clear memo)
- Photos (optional: meeting setup, workspace configuration)

### Key Insight
**Can use BOTH home office rent (12 months) AND Augusta Rule (14 days) in same year - they stack!**

## Retirement Optimization

### Solo 401k Strategy (Current)
- Rolled out of Guideline (low returns, no crypto access)
- Target: MySolo401k ($525 setup, direct crypto trading)
- Contribution: Up to $70K/year (2025 limits)
- Investment allocation: 50% Bitcoin, 30% MSTR stock, 20% cash
- **Key benefit:** Tax-deferred Bitcoin accumulation

### Why Solo 401k > IRA
- IRA: Only $7K/year contribution
- Solo 401k: $70K/year (much larger tax game)
- Keep 401k structure, don't convert to IRA

### Status Check Needed
- Did 401k rollover complete? (Oct 26, 2025 deadline passed)
- Is MySolo401k established?
- Can trade crypto yet?

## R&D Tax Credits

### Eligible Activities
- Software development wages
- Cloud/hosting costs
- Technical experimentation
- Product innovation

### Safe Harbor Approach
- Include: Legitimate technical wages, software, cloud
- Exclude: Advertising, marketing, general admin
- 2025 decision: Removed $333K advertising from claim
- **Final credit:** $23,600 (conservative, audit-resistant)

### Philosophy
"Paid $28K extra to feel rich" - sovereignty > maximum credit

## Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments

### When
April 15, June 15, Sept 15, Jan 15 (following year)

### Why
Self-employment income not withheld, must pay estimated quarterly

### Calculation
1. Estimate annual income (business profit + other income)
2. Calculate tax liability (federal + state + self-employment)
3. Subtract withheld/credits
4. Divide by 4 = Quarterly payment

### Safe Harbor
- Pay 100% of prior year tax (110% if AGI > $150K)
- OR pay 90% of current year estimated tax
- Avoids underpayment penalty

### Action
- Brad should calculate quarterly payments
- Set calendar reminders (2 weeks before deadline)
- Make payments via IRS Direct Pay or EFTPS

---

## Strategic Intelligence

### What Works (Proven)
- Home office deduction (33% at old place, 60% at new = justified by 2nd employee)
- R&D credits (conservative approach = $23,600, audit-resistant)
- Solo 401k rollover (escaped 0% returns at Guideline → Bitcoin access)

### What to Avoid (Learned)
- Advertising in R&D credit (removed $333K, chose sovereignty)
- Excessive deductions (audit risk > small tax savings)
- Missing deadlines (IRS notices compound if ignored)

### Future Opportunities
**2025 actions:**
1. Complete Augusta Rule for October (Diwali retreat = $4K tax-free)
2. Verify 401k rollover to MySolo401k (Oct 26 deadline passed)
3. Start corporate Bitcoin purchases (T&E treasury $120K → Bitcoin)

**2026 planning:**
1. Increase 401k contributions ($70K/year → 50% Bitcoin, 30% MSTR)
2. Formalize Augusta Rule annually (plan 2026 retreat early)
3. Corporate Bitcoin treasury (regular purchases vs lump sum?)
4. Quarterly estimated taxes (avoid surprise bills)
