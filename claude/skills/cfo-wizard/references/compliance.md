# Regulatory Compliance & Audit Defense

## IRS Notice Response Protocol

### Example: Notice 2030 (2025)
- **Issue:** Tax year 2023 underreporting claim
- **Amount:** $244K (Apple 1099-K mismatch)
- **Reality:** $169K actual receipts
- **Deadline:** Nov 6, 2025
- **Status:** Brad investigating

### Response Framework
1. **Identify notice type** (CP2000, Notice 2030, audit letter)
2. **Gather evidence** (bank statements, receipts, correct 1099s)
3. **Calculate correct amount** (what should have been reported)
4. **Draft response** (explain discrepancy, provide proof)
5. **CPA review** (Brad reviews before mailing)
6. **Mail certified** (return receipt, proof of delivery)
7. **Follow up** (track status, respond to additional requests)

### Key Principle
Don't ignore, respond with evidence, keep calm

## 1099-K Reconciliation (Cash vs Accrual Timing)

### Common Scenario
App Store/Stripe/Payment Processor 1099-K mismatch

### What Happens
- Payment processor reports on **accrual basis** (revenue earned)
- You file on **cash basis** (revenue received)
- Payment processor has **45-60 day lag** between earning and payment
- Year-end earnings (Nov/Dec) get paid next year (Jan/Feb)
- IRS sees discrepancy between 1099-K and your return

### Example: Apple App Store (Oct 2025 Case)

**IRS Notice Claims:**
- Apple 1099-Ks show $414,055 for 2023
- Your return shows $169,936 for 2023
- Difference: $244,119 "unreported"

**Reality:**
- Apple reports when revenue EARNED (2023)
- You report when cash RECEIVED (when hit bank)
- Nov/Dec 2023 earnings paid Jan/Feb 2024
- All $244K reported on 2024 return ✓

### Reconciliation Template

1. **Get all 1099-Ks from payer**
   - Apple Inc (US): $XXX,XXX
   - Apple International: $XX,XXX
   - Apple Canada: $XX,XXX
   - Total: $XXX,XXX

2. **Get payer's financial reports** (monthly payment details)
   - Shows when revenue "earned" vs when "paid"
   - Proves 45-60 day payment lag
   - Example: Oct earnings → Dec payment

3. **Get bank statements** (actual deposits)
   - Cross-reference each monthly payment
   - Sum total received in tax year
   - Proves cash basis = accurate

4. **Build reconciliation table:**

| Month Earned | Report Amount | Bank Deposit Date | Bank Amount | Tax Year |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Jan 2023 | $XXX | Mar 2023 | $XXX | 2023 ✓ |
| Feb 2023 | $XXX | Apr 2023 | $XXX | 2023 ✓ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Oct 2023 | $XXX | Dec 2023 | $XXX | 2023 ✓ |
| Nov 2023 | $XXX | Jan 2024 | $XXX | 2024 ✓ |
| Dec 2023 | $XXX | Feb 2024 | $XXX | 2024 ✓ |
| **TOTAL** | **$XXX,XXX** | **Year 1 + 2** | **$XXX,XXX** | **Both years** |

5. **Verify timing difference = reported in next year return**
   - Next year return shows total revenue of $X,XXX,XXX
   - Includes the $XXX,XXX timing difference ✓
   - Nothing was unreported or hidden

### Form 15113 Response Language

```
Dear IRS,

Re: Notice 2030 - Tax Year [YEAR]

Trial and Error Inc files on the cash basis method of accounting (IRS-approved).

[Payment Processor] reports on the accrual basis (revenue when earned).

Due to [Payment Processor]'s 45-60 day payment processing lag, revenue earned
in November-December [YEAR] was not paid to our bank account until
January-February [YEAR+1].

Per cash basis accounting, we correctly reported this revenue in [YEAR+1]
when the cash was actually received.

RECONCILIATION:
- [Payment Processor] 1099-K (accrual): $XXX,XXX
- Cash received in [YEAR]: $XXX,XXX (see attached bank statements)
- Cash received in [YEAR+1]: $XXX,XXX (see attached [YEAR+1] return)
- Total matches 1099-K: $XXX,XXX ✓

All revenue has been properly reported. No additional tax is owed.

Attached:
1. Bank statements ([YEAR] deposits)
2. Bank statements ([YEAR+1] deposits showing timing difference)
3. [Payment Processor] monthly financial reports (proving payment lag)
4. [YEAR+1] tax return (showing timing difference revenue)

Please adjust our account accordingly.
```

### Evidence Checklist
- ✓ All 1099-K forms (from payer or IRS transcript)
- ✓ Bank statements (both tax years)
- ✓ Payer financial reports (monthly payment schedules)
- ✓ Tax returns (both years)
- ✓ Reconciliation table (month-by-month proof)

### Outcome
IRS accepts explanation, case closed, $0 owed

### Time to Resolve
4-8 weeks from response submission

### Preventive Measure
Next year, include note with return explaining cash basis timing

## Audit Defense Preparation

### Document Retention
- Tax returns: Forever (keep all years)
- Supporting docs: 7 years minimum
- Bank statements: 7 years
- Receipts: 7 years (digital copies acceptable)
- Contracts/agreements: Lifetime of contract + 7 years

### Audit-Proof Strategies
- Conservative calculations (don't inflate)
- Clear documentation (photos, contracts, memos)
- Business purpose evidence (agendas, meeting notes)
- Arms-length transactions (market-rate pricing)
- Professional preparation (CPA involvement)

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Round numbers without justification
- 100% business use claims (cars, phones)
- Disproportionate deductions (vs income)
- Lack of documentation (no receipts/proof)
- Related-party transactions without market rates
