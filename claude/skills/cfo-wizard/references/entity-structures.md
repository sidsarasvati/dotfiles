# Entity Structures & Management

## Business Structure (T&E/RenovateAI)

### Trial and Error, Inc. (T&E)
- Primary entity for operations
- Payroll: Sid Sarasvati (CEO), Saie Mogre (Chief of Staff)
- Bank: Mercury (business checking)
- Card: Ramp (business expenses)
- Payroll/401k: Gusto
- CPA: Brad (email available, mostly MIA but fast when engaged)

### RenovateAI
- Revenue: $290K MRR = $3.48M ARR
- Bootstrapped to $3M+ ARR (profitable)
- B2B: ~$20K/mo additional
- Separate entity or under T&E umbrella (clarify if needed)

### Financials
- T&E treasury: $120K-$200K cash
- Personal wealth: $3.5M invested ($3M Bitcoin)
- Bitcoin strategy: MicroStrategy model (aggressive accumulation)

## Payroll Strategy

### Current
- Sid Sarasvati: CEO salary (amount TBD - check Gusto)
- Saie Mogre: Chief of Staff salary (amount TBD - check Gusto)

### Optimization Questions
- Reasonable compensation? (S-Corp requirement if applicable)
- W-2 vs distributions? (tax efficiency)
- Health insurance? (deductible if provided)
- Retirement contributions? (401k match, profit sharing)

### Action
Review Gusto setup, confirm salary amounts, ensure compliance

---

## Cross-Entity Transactions

### If RenovateAI = Separate Entity
- Management fees (T&E → RenovateAI for services)
- Shared expenses (how allocated?)
- Transfer pricing (arms-length requirement)
- Intercompany accounting (track balances)

### If RenovateAI = Under T&E
- Single entity, simpler accounting
- All revenue/expenses in one place
- No intercompany complexity

### Action Needed
Clarify structure with Brad

## Wealth Management Strategy

### Personal Strategy
- **Total invested:** $3.5M
- **Bitcoin allocation:** $3M (85% of portfolio)
- **Other:** $500K (cash, stocks, diversification)
- **Philosophy:** Bitcoin = wealth preservation, not speculation
- **Strategy:** "Make profits → Buy Bitcoin" (MicroStrategy model)

### Corporate Treasury Strategy
- **Current T&E cash:** $120K-$200K
- **Goal:** Corporate Bitcoin purchases (avoid double taxation)
- **Tax benefit:** Corp buys Bitcoin directly vs Sid takes distribution + personal purchase
- **MicroStrategy model:** Aggressive Bitcoin treasury accumulation
- **Morgan Stanley:** Exploring corporate Bitcoin custody/tax structures

### Questions for Wealth Advisors
- Corporate Bitcoin purchase tax treatment?
- Custody solutions for corporate Bitcoin?
- Private markets access for $120K-$200K treasury?
- Tax-efficient structures for company purchases?
