## Protocol: Home Office Rent Payment

### Method: Payment Request (Preferred)
**When:** Monthly (or catch-up batch)
**Amount:** $5,000/month
**Method:** Mercury Payment Request (invoice from personal → business)

### Why Payment Request > ACH Transfer
- ✅ Creates formal invoice (landlord billing tenant)
- ✅ Built-in documentation (request notes = memo)
- ✅ Professional appearance (arms-length transaction)
- ✅ Permanent payment link (audit trail)
- ✅ Business approval step (not just owner moving money)

### Steps
1. **From personal Mercury account:** Create payment request
2. **To:** Trial & Error, Inc (sid@trialanderror.ai)
3. **Amount:** $5,000 × number of months (e.g., $20,000 for 4 months)
4. **Request notes:** `Office space rental for [month(s)] 2025`
   - Example: "Office space rental for june, july, august, september 2025"
5. **Send request** → Business account receives invoice
6. **From business Mercury account:** Approve/pay request
7. **Mercury marks PAID** → Screenshot the paid status
8. **Save payment request link** → Permanent record
9. **Update transfer log** → Note payment request ID

### Documentation
- Home office agreement (annual)
- Photos of office spaces (keep updated)
- Payment request screenshots (PAID status visible)
- Payment links (permanent in Mercury)
- Request notes (clear documentation)
- Saie's employment proof (she's on payroll, works from home)

### Audit Advantage
IRS sees: Landlord bills tenant → Tenant pays invoice → Proper landlord-tenant relationship
(Even though same person, the FORM creates professional separation)

## Protocol: Augusta Rule Rental Payment

**When:** Once per year (14-day maximum)
**Amount:** $3,000-$5,000 (justified by business purpose)
**From:** Mercury (T&E business account)
**To:** Sid's personal account

### Steps
1. **Plan event:** Business retreat, board meeting, team gathering
2. **Document business purpose:**
   - Create agenda (specific business sessions)
   - List attendees (names, roles)
   - Write business objectives memo
   - Schedule: Which 14 days? (consecutive or spread)
3. **Calculate rate:**
   - Conservative: Pro-rata monthly rent
   - Market-based: Comparable venue costs
   - Choose defensible amount
4. **Execute payment:**
   - Create Mercury payment request (personal → business)
   - Amount: $3,000-$5,000 (justified rate)
   - Request notes: "14-day business retreat rental - [Month] 2025 (Augusta Rule IRC 280A(g))"
   - Business approves request
   - Save payment request screenshot + link
5. **Create documentation package:**
   - Event agenda
   - Attendee list
   - Business purpose memo
   - Rental agreement
   - Payment confirmation
   - Photos (optional)
6. **Year-end:** Provide to Brad for review
7. **Personal taxes:** Do NOT report as income (Augusta Rule exemption)

### Key Distinction
This is SEPARATE from monthly home office rent - they stack!

## Ramp Expense Management

### Purpose
Business credit card, replaces bookkeeper
- Automatically categorizes expenses
- Receipt capture (photo/upload)
- Monthly reports for review

### Best Practices
- Categorize at time of purchase (don't batch later)
- Upload receipts immediately (photo via app)
- Review monthly (catch mis-categorizations)
- Year-end: Export for tax filing

### Watch For
- Personal expenses on business card (reimburse/reclassify)
- Subscriptions bleeding $0 ROI (Semrush lesson: $651 recovered)
- Category errors (dining → meals & entertainment vs office supplies)

## Gusto Payroll + 401k

### Employees
- Sid Sarasvati (CEO)
- Saie Mogre (Chief of Staff) - **CRITICAL: On T&E payroll, works from home**

### Payroll Schedule
[Clarify: Bi-weekly? Monthly?]

### 401k Status
- Previously: Guideline (acquired by Gusto)
- Oct 26, 2025: Consent deadline for Gusto transfer
- Decision: Did not consent → Forced rollover
- Target: MySolo401k (crypto access)
- **Action needed:** Verify rollover status

---

## Protocol: Monthly Financial Close

### Purpose
Stay organized, catch issues early, prepare for taxes

### Tasks

**1. Review Ramp expenses:**
- Check categorization
- Upload missing receipts
- Flag personal expenses
- Identify $0 ROI subscriptions

**2. Review Mercury transactions:**
- Reconcile transfers
- Verify all payments logged
- Check for unusual activity

**3. Review Gusto payroll:**
- Confirm payroll processed
- Check tax withholdings
- Verify 401k contributions

**4. Update financial tracker:**
- Cash balance (Mercury)
- Revenue (RenovateAI MRR)
- Expenses (Ramp + other)
- Profit (revenue - expenses)

**5. Flag issues:**
- Unusual expenses
- Missing documentation
- Potential tax questions

### Frequency
Monthly (first week of following month)

### Time
30-60 minutes

### Output
Clean books, questions list for Brad

## Vendor Management Lessons

### What Works (Proven)
- Semrush: Cancelled, $651 recovered (CEO escalation works)
- Guideline: Exited by missing consent deadline (forced rollover = outcome wanted)
- Ramp: Replaced $200/mo bookkeeper (automation > human)

### What to Avoid (Learned)
- $0 ROI subscriptions (Semrush bled $4,959/year generating $0)
- Auto-renewals without review (price jumps, unauthorized add-ons)
- Dark patterns (5-page cancellation flow)
