# Iron-Sid Protocols

All proven workout, nutrition, and recovery protocols.

---

## SESSION PREP PROTOCOL (Phone Brain Dump Format)

**BEHAVIORAL STRATUM**: Zero friction on phone - Sid brain dumps between sets at HR 140+.

### Formatting Rules
**NEVER use** (creates visual clutter):
- Bold text
- Italic text
- Bullet points (• or -)
- Underscores for blanks (___)

**ALWAYS use** (clean + scannable):
- ALL CAPS for headers
- Plain text only
- Blank lines for brain dump space
- Short lines (fits phone width)
- Numbers for sets (SET 1, SET 2)
- Separators between major sections (═══)

### Structure
1. **Session Header**: Title, date, day count, mission
2. **Numbers to Destroy**: Last session performance (fuel the fire)
3. **Warmup Section**: Standing only, glute activation FIRST
4. **Exercise Blocks**: ANCHOR 1, ANCHOR 2, PUMP 1, PUMP 2
5. **Cooldown Section**: Stretches checklist
6. **Summary Block**: Duration, HR, progressions, notes

### Exercise Block Format
```
ANCHOR 1: EXERCISE NAME WEIGHT
Target: XX+ reps (beat YY)

Last time: 10/10/10/13 = 43

### Key Elements
- **Blank lines** - Sid types reps/thoughts (no deletion needed)
- **Rep targets per set** - Specific numbers from last session +1-2
- **Motivational pumps** - IRON voice ("King Kong", "Vampire Slayer")
- **Execution tips** - 3-4 form/mental cues
- **Strategy context** - What pattern we're aiming for

## PRE-WORKOUT NUTRITION PROTOCOL

**Timing**: 60 minutes BEFORE workout

### The Stack (Optimal absorption)
1. **Pea Protein** (1 scoop in shake)
2. **Di-Leucine** (Unmatched capsules - fixes pea protein leucine gap)
3. **Creatine** (Unmatched - mix in shake, not intra-workout)
4. **Greek Yogurt or Kefir** (1/2 cup blended - protein boost + probiotics)

### Intra-Workout (Separate)
- **LMNT + Electrashed** in water bottle
- Sip between sets (hydration, electrolytes, pump - not fuel)

### Why This Works
- Protein timing + leucine optimization = muscle preservation during recomp
- Empty stomach lifting = muscle breakdown risk
- Pre-loaded amino acids available during training

### Daily Protein Priority
- **Target**: 150g minimum (163g ideal = 1g/lb)
- **Pre-workout**: 60 min before
- **Post-workout**: Within 30 min
- **Pre-bed**: Casein shake (NEVER miss - muscle synthesis during sleep)

---

## WARMUP PROTOCOL - STANDING ONLY

**CRITICAL**: No mat work. Standing = no friction to skip.

### Phase 1: Glute Activation (3 min) - FIRST, ALWAYS

**Problem**: Anterior pelvic tilt (weak glutes → lower back compensates)
**Detection**: Lower back feeling before workout = glutes not firing

1. **Standing Glute Squeezes**: 20 reps
   - Squeeze HARD 2 seconds each
   - Wake up sleeping stabilizers
   - Fixes pelvic tilt pattern

2. **Single-Leg RDL Bodyweight**: 10 each leg
   - Fires gluteus medius (the lower back culprit + knee stability)
   - Hold wall/rack for balance if needed
   - Prevents knee collapse pattern

3. **Wall Planks**: 30 seconds
   - Hands on wall, walk feet back, lean in
   - Core bracing practice
   - Core tight = back safe

### Phase 2: Movement Prep (2 min) - AFTER glutes activated
1. **Arm Circles**: 10 forward/10 back
2. **Shoulder Rolls**: 10 each direction
3. **Dead Hang**: 10-20 seconds (scapula engagement, grip activation)
4. **Wall Push-ups**: 10 reps [Push days]
5. **Light DB Press**: 10-15 lbs x 10 reps [Push days]

### Phase 3: Recovery Tool (Post-Workout) - MANDATORY
**Dead Hangs**: 20-30 seconds
- "Spine elongating in real time. Just to feel alpha"
- Decompress spine after loaded movements
- Pre-workout: 10-20 sec (engagement)
- Post-workout: 20-30 sec (decompression)

**Success Metric**: Glutes firing, shoulders loose, core braced, lower back feeling gone.

## WORKOUT EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Main Work (35-45 min)
- 4 exercises typical
- 3-4 sets per exercise
- Rest as needed (not tracked)
- Sip LMNT + Electrashed between sets

### Cooldown (5 min)
- Target muscle stretches
- Deep breathing (5 breaths)
- Notes capture in Apple Notes
- Dead hangs (20-30 sec)

### Time Block Colors (Journal)
- 🟩 Focus = Desk work, concentrated
- 🟪 Misc = At desk but not focused
- 🟨 Yellow = Away from desk
- 🟦 Blue = Physical activity (workouts)

---

## WORKOUT LEARNING LOOP PROTOCOL

### Phase 0: Pre-Workout (Iron-Sid creates format)
- Apple Notes format optimized for phone
- Blank lines for brain dump (zero friction)
- IRON voice motivation per set
- Imagery + anchors + pump language
- Tips before each exercise

### Phase 1: Execution (Sid's brain dump)
- Copy format to Apple Notes
- Brain dump between sets (HR 140+, no editing friction)
- Raw captures: reps, feels, rants, breakthroughs
- "12 reps felt strong" or "FUCK YEAH SMASHED IT"

### Phase 2: Post-Workout (Sid pastes back)
- Filled workout notes (raw, unedited)
- Inline thoughts between sets
- Rants, feelings, discoveries
- King Kong feels, breakthroughs, frustrations

### Phase 3: Iron-Sid's Learning Extraction
1. Extract Performance Data (actual reps, totals, HR, progressions)
2. Capture Mental Breakthroughs (King Kong moments, insights)
3. Learn Sid's Capture Style (language patterns)
4. Update Session File (fill in data, capture quotes)
5. Update NOW.md (new baselines, next targets)
6. Update Journal (brief summary)
7. Evolve Format Protocol (if friction detected, adjust)

**The Loop**: Format improves with each session → Capturing becomes effortless.

## SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### Injury Prevention
- **Wrist issues**: Always use push-up handles
- **Lower back**: Glute activation + wide stance on ALL standing exercises
- **Core engagement**: Active bracing on all lifts
- **Form over weight**: 25lbs good form > 35lbs bad form

### Wide Stance Principle
Universal fix for lower back pressure:
- Applies to: Biceps curls, face pulls, squats, RDLs, all standing movements
- Wider stance = core engaged automatically
- "Biceps wide stance really made these last 2 exercises not annoy me"

### Recovery Rules
- 2-3 days optimal between sessions
- Extended breaks OK if protein maintained
- Weekend indulgences: Don't panic, movement flushes systems
- Soreness = progress (especially hamstrings)

## THREE-LOCATION TRACKING PROTOCOL

**When weight data provided, record in ALL THREE places:**

### 1. Master Tracking File
- **Purpose**: Complete history, patterns, full story
- **Format**: `Day XX (Date): XXX.X lbs @ XX.X% BF, XXX.X lbs muscle - [Status/notes]`

### 2. Current State File (NOW.md)
- **Purpose**: Quick load context
- **Update on every weigh-in**

### 3. Journal
- **Purpose**: Natural timeline in graph
- **Format**: Nested under project block

### Why All Three
- Master = Historical data analysis
- NOW.md = Fast context loading
- Journal = Timeline integration

## KAIZEN CORE PROTOCOL

**Daily Victory Hour Core Work** (5 min, not heroic):
1. Plank: 30-60 sec
2. Dead bug: 10 reps each side (anti-extension)
3. Bird dog: 10 reps each side (anti-rotation)
4. Hollow body hold: 20-30 sec (deep core)

**Gym Warmup Enhancement**:
1. Wall planks → Floor planks (30-60 sec)
2. Add hollow body holds (20 sec)
3. Core activation BEFORE glute activation

**Behavioral Stratum**:
- Before EVERY rep: "Core tight" cue
- Breath pattern: Inhale top, exhale effort, core braced throughout
- Track: Plank time daily, "core tight" vs "low back pain" in notes

---

## EXTENDED SUPERCOMPENSATION PROTOCOL

**The Pattern** (Scientifically Validated):
- 13-14 day gap = breakthrough conditions
- Session 021: 13-day gap → 60 goblet squats (+62%)
- Session 027: 13-day gap → 60 goblet squats (EXACT MATCH)

**The Mechanism**:
1. Extended rest → Complete nervous system reset
2. Casein + protein protocol → Muscle preserved
3. Initial resistance (Sets 1-2 adaptation)
4. Rhythm explosion (Sets 3-4)

**Strategic Application**:
- Gap strategically AFTER heavy sessions
- Maintain protein throughout
- Expect initial doubt (normal), then explosion (expected)
- NOT failure - STRATEGIC TOOL

---

## OPTIMAL TIMING PROTOCOL

**Victory Hour → 10 AM Workout = OPTIMAL**
- 5 AM wake → Morning Pages → Yoga → Mooji
- 5 hours absorption before workout (energy peak)
- Post-workout 2h nap = recovery tool with low sleep
- Works even with low sleep (nap compensates)

**Validated in**: Sessions 023, 027

*Protocols improve through execution. When patterns fail, update the protocol.*
