# Progress Tracking Framework

> **"50 words per level - clear milestones, celebration protocols"**
> **"Primary source: vocab.md | Skill reference: arsenal-words.md"**

## Tracking Philosophy

**Primary source of truth:** `/pages/vocab.md` in Logseq
- Sid's working document
- Updated during vocab sessions
- Contains all arsenal words + patterns + drills

**Skill reference:** `.claude/skills/elster-vocab/references/arsenal-words.md`
- Copy of arsenal section for skill loading
- Sync after vocab sessions
- Used when skill activates

**Sid decides what's arsenal-worthy** - Atlas suggests, Sid approves

## The Level System

**Verbal Advantage structure:**
- 50 words per level (Levels 1-20)
- 1000 words total across all levels
- Progressive difficulty (Level 1 = Foundation → Level 20 = Mastery)

**Current progress:**
- **Level 1: Words 1-50** (Day 52: completed 1-30, **20 remaining**)
- **16 arsenal weapons captured** (from 30 words reviewed)
- **1 pronunciation drill created** (The Practitioner)

## Arsenal vs Reviewed

**Not every word becomes arsenal weapon:**
- **Reviewed:** All words from Verbal Advantage (highlight PDF, read definitions)
- **Arsenal:** SPECIAL words extracted (pronunciation value + writing weapon)

**Current ratio:** 16 arsenal / 30 reviewed = ~53% capture rate

**Why selective?**
- Arsenal = weapons Sid will USE (demos, writing, speaking)
- Not academic collection
- Quality > quantity

## Progress Metrics

**Day counter:**
- Started: Jan 22, 2024 (90-90-1 protocol)
- Current: Day 53/90 (Nov 4, 2025)
- Remaining: 37 days to complete

**Session frequency:**
- Day 47-48: Aug 8-11, 2025 (identity breakthrough)
- Day 52: Nov 3, 2025 (pronunciation system discovered)
- Day 53: Nov 4, 2025 (elster-vocab skill created)
- Average: Accelerating with AI-native approach

**Level 1 progress:**
- Words 1-30: Complete ✓
- Words 31-50: In progress (14/20 completed)
- Estimated completion: Week of Nov 11, 2025

## Milestone Celebrations

**At each 50-word level completion:**

### Celebration Protocol

1. **Review patterns learned:**
   - Which patterns emerged this level?
   - Which word families unlocked?
   - Key insights captured?

2. **Create commemorative drill:**
   - Use 5-7 best weapons from this level
   - Practitioner context celebrating progress
   - Example: "Level 1 Complete: The Foundation"

3. **Update skill references:**
   - Sync arsenal-words.md from vocab.md
   - Document new patterns in pronunciation-patterns.md
   - Add drill to practitioner-sentences.md

4. **Journal documentation:**
   - Day count: "Day X/90 - Level 1 Complete!"
   - Breakthrough insights
   - Seeds planted for next level

5. **Progress reflection:**
   - Confidence check: American accent improving?
   - Pattern recognition active?
   - Drills feel natural?

**Level milestones:**
- Level 1 (Words 1-50): Foundation patterns
- Level 2 (Words 51-100): Complex combinations
- Level 3 (Words 101-150): Mastery & nuance
- Level 4-5 (Words 151-250): Advanced vocabulary

## Day 53 Progress Snapshot

**Discoveries today:**
- **MASTER KEY**: Stress-timing principle (THE breakthrough)
- **Pattern consolidation**: omni-, -ant/-ate/-ent, re- prefix
- **Drill system**: Created "The Practitioner" drill
- **Skill creation**: elster-vocab skill built (9 files, full architecture)

**Arsenal additions (Day 52-53):**
- MANIFOLD (Word 31)
- PLIANT (Word 32) - Major pattern
- RETORT (Word 33)
- OBSTINATE (Word 34)
- LACERATE (Word 35)
- OMNIPOTENT (Word 36) - Unlocks omni- family

**System maturity:**
- Pronunciation protocol operational
- Drill generation protocol documented
- Word family teaching structured
- Coaching voice calibrated

**Next session priority:**
- Continue Words 37-50 (14 remaining in Level 1)
- Practice Drill #1 daily (build muscle memory)
- Watch for new patterns

## Tracking in Journal

**During vocab session (in journal time block):**
```markdown
- 🟩 *7:00 - 9:00 AM*: **2H** Vocabulary Session **Day 53**
  - [[P/Writing Expertise]]
    - Verbal Advantage Level 1: Words 31-36
    - 6 arsenal weapons added
    - MASTER KEY discovered (stress-timing principle)
    - Created elster-vocab skill
```

**Brief, collapsed details in journal - full capture in project files**

## Data Sources

**Primary data (single source of truth):**
- `/pages/vocab.md` - Arsenal section
  - Cheat sheet (patterns)
  - Arsenal words (16 weapons)
  - Drills (The Practitioner)
  - Progress tracker

**Project memory:**
- `/projects/writing-expertise/MEMORY.md` - Session archive
- `/projects/writing-expertise/NOW.md` - Current state

**Skill files (reference copies):**
- `references/arsenal-words.md` - Synced from vocab.md
- `references/pronunciation-patterns.md` - Synced from vocab.md cheat sheet
- `drills/practitioner-sentences.md` - Synced from vocab.md drills

## Sync Protocol

**After each vocab session:**

1. **Update vocab.md** (during session)
   - Add new arsenal words
   - Update progress tracker
   - Create/refine drills

2. **Close Writing Expertise project** (end of session)
   - Write to MEMORY.md (session archive)
   - Update NOW.md (current state)
   - Document breakthrough insights

3. **Sync skill files** (when patterns change significantly)
   - Copy arsenal section → arsenal-words.md
   - Copy cheat sheet → pronunciation-patterns.md
   - Copy drills → practitioner-sentences.md

**Frequency:** Skill sync after every 10 new words or major pattern discovery

## Success Metrics

**Level completion criteria:**
- [ ] All 50 words reviewed (highlighted in PDF)
- [ ] 20-30 arsenal weapons captured (40-60% capture rate)
- [ ] 2-3 major patterns documented
- [ ] 3-5 word families unlocked
- [ ] 2-3 pronunciation drills created
- [ ] Confidence with stress-timing principle

**Skill maturity indicators:**
- [ ] Can create drills on-demand
- [ ] Pattern recognition automatic
- [ ] Word families intuitive
- [ ] American accent emerging naturally

**Sid's test:**
> "I feel confident when I PUNCH stressed syllables. The rhythm emerges naturally."

## Future Enhancements

**After Level 1 complete:**

**Possible additions:**
- Auto-suggest drills when 5+ new words added?
- Celebration protocol automation?
- Pattern quiz system (test retention)?
- Spaced repetition for arsenal words?

**Start simple:** Reference vocab.md, add tracking later if needed

**The principle:** Don't over-engineer. Let system evolve through usage.
