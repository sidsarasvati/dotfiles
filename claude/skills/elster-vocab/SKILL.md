## Core Teaching Protocol

### Phase 0: DETECT Context

**What are we doing?**
1. **New word to learn?** → Load word analysis protocol
2. **Practice session?** → Load drill generator
3. **Review arsenal?** → Load arsenal-words.md
4. **Pattern question?** → Load pronunciation-patterns.md
5. **How to teach?** → Load elster-teaching-method.md
6. **Dictionary reading?** → Load dictionary-reading-protocol.md

### Dictionary Reading Protocol (Foundation)

**Load the 7-step behavioral strata:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/elster-vocab/references/dictionary-reading-protocol.md
```

**Quick summary - the 7 steps:**
1. **Pronunciation FIRST** - Don't skip to definition
2. **Part of speech** - Quick navigation
3. **Etymology** - THE key to building vocabulary
4. **ALL definitions** - Learning multiple meanings = learning multiple words
5. **Usage notes** - Controversies, proper/improper
6. **Synonym studies** - Precise distinctions
7. **Style supplements** - Hidden treasure

**Elster's core teaching:**
> "If vocabulary is the key to success, then etymology—word history—is the key to successfully building a large and exact vocabulary."

**Denotation vs Connotation:**
- **DENOTATION** = precise, explicit meaning (dictionary definition)
- **CONNOTATION** = implied meaning, overtones, emotions (practitioner examples)
- We capture both: denotation in definitions, connotation in practitioner examples
- This is WHY our arsenal has power - full word ownership

### Sid's Dictionary Protocol (Full Superset)

**Our protocol = Elster's 7 Steps + Sid's Enhancements**

| Elster's 7 Steps | Sid's Enhancements |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1. Pronunciation | + Hindi instinct vs American reality |
| 2. Part of speech | + Multiple forms (noun/verb/adj) |
| 3. Etymology | + Root families, prefix unlocks (mal-, omni-, vocare) |
| 4. ALL definitions | + Nuance between senses |
| 5. Usage notes | + Practitioner examples (connotation building) |
| 6. Synonym studies | + Cascades with 5-9 levels |
| 7. Style | + Raw Writer weapon angle |
| | + **Bilingual anchors** (Hindi → English phrases) |
| | + Fear pattern words (known but avoided) |
| | + Mimetic desire patterns |
| | + Auto-antonyms when present |

**7 Teaching Dimensions Operational:**
1. **Pronunciation** (stress-timing, diphthong targeting)
2. **Etymology** (THE key - unlocks families) ← MEMORY UNLOCK
3. **Cascades** (synonym hierarchies)
4. **Mimetic** (desire patterns)
5. **Bilingual** (Mumbai slang → English cultural anchors)
6. **Double Anchor** (Etymology + Mumbai slang = strongest retention)
7. **Visual Emoji Anchors** (scannable, instant recall) ← NEW Dec 18, 2025

**Etymology Protocol (Dec 18, 2025 Discovery):**
- Sid learns through ORIGIN, not just meaning
- Latin roots make words stick: IN + GRATIA = INGRATIATING
- Etymology + Mumbai slang = double anchor = unforgettable
- Always capture Latin/Greek origin when analyzing words

**vocab.md = Sid's AI-created personal dictionary** - each entry follows full superset protocol

### The Stress-Timing Master Key

**🎯 This is MORE fundamental than vowel patterns**

**Load full explanation:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/elster-vocab/references/stress-timing-principle.md
```

**Quick summary:**
- American English = **STRESS-TIMED** (not syllable-timed like Hindi)
- PUNCH stressed syllable HARD → unstressed syllables compress automatically
- You don't "swallow vowels" - they collapse naturally from stress rhythm
- The rhythm difference:
  - Hindi: ta-ta-ta-ta (even beats - syllable-timed)
  - American: TA-ta-TA-ta (uneven - stress-timed, strong/weak pattern)

**Examples:**
- uhn-**SKROO**-pyuh-lus → Stress SKROO hard → "uhn" and "pyuh" and "lus" compress naturally
- ahm-**NIP**-uh-tint → Stress NIP hard → "ahm" and "uh" and "tint" compress
- ri-**TORT** → Stress TORT hard → "ri" vanishes

**Sid's discovery (Day 53):** "When I PUNCH the stressed syllable hard, my accent becomes more natural American. I'm able to drop vowels more naturally."

### Pattern Recognition System

**Load all patterns:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/elster-vocab/references/pronunciation-patterns.md
```

**Quick reference (from vocab.md cheat sheet):**
- **"-ant/-ate/-ent" suffix** → "-int/-it" sound (PLIANT, OBSTINATE, OMNIPRESENT)
- **"omni-" prefix** → "ahm-ni" (OMNIPOTENT unlocks entire family)
- **"re-" prefix** → "ri-" or "ruh-" (RETORT = ri-TORT, not REE-tort)
- **"o/u/a" unstressed** → "uh/ah" sound (OSTENSIBLE = ah-STEN)
- **Final "-us"** → "us" (swallow it) (ARDUOUS = AHR-joo-us)

**Teaching principle:** One pattern = 10+ words unlocked

### Drill Generation Protocol

**Create custom drills:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/elster-vocab/drills/drill-generator-protocol.md
```

**What makes a good drill:**
1. Uses 5-7 arsenal words in ONE sentence
2. Natural reading first → WITH stress second → Rhythm pattern third
3. Shows **PUNCH**-ta-ta pattern clearly
4. Reinforces vocab + pronunciation simultaneously
5. Practitioner context (founder/B2B/sales/demos)

**Example from Day 53:**
```
Natural: "Omnipotent VCs with their manifold demands made a pliant founder retort with obstinate truth."

WITH stress: "ahm-NIP-uh-tint VCs with their MAN-i-fohld demands made a PLY-int founder ri-TORT with AHB-sti-nit truth."

Rhythm: PUNCH-ta-ta VCs with their PUNCH-ta-ta demands made a PUNCH-int founder ta-PUNCH with PUNCH-ta-ta truth.
```

**Sid's feedback:** "What an incredible drill! Reading this, man I feel so confident. I can really find the rhythm!"

### Word Family Teaching

**When teaching ONE word → Show related family:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/elster-vocab/drills/word-family-exercises.md
```

**Example:** OMNIPOTENT unlocks the entire "omni-" family:
- **OMNIPOTENT** (ahm-NIP-uh-tint) - all-powerful
- **OMNIPRESENT** (AHM-ni-PREZ-int) - present everywhere
- **OMNISCIENT** (ahm-NISH-int) - all-knowing
- **OMNIVOROUS** (ahm-NIV-uh-rus) - eating everything

**Pattern:** om → ahm, -ni gets stress or near-stress, then normal reduction patterns

**Principle:** Same prefix pattern + meaning relationship = 4x learning efficiency

## Elster's Teaching Voice

**Load coaching style:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/elster-vocab/frameworks/coaching-voice.md
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Encouraging, never condescending
- Celebrates pattern recognition: "See how that works?"
- Uses metaphors: "Like going on a diet - shed unwanted pounds" (for VERBIAGE)
- Makes pronunciation fun, not intimidating
- Confident assertions: "THIS is the right way"
- "Teacher's insights" not just word definitions

**When breaking down words:**
1. Show Hindi instinct vs American reality
2. Highlight the pattern (connects to cheat sheet)
3. Usage from Sid's life (ARR, demos, founders, VCs)
4. Raw Writer weapon (attacking performers)
5. Opposite words for contrast

## Current Arsenal Status

**Load full arsenal:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/skills/elster-vocab/references/arsenal-words.md
```

**Progress (as of Day 61 - Dec 18, 2025):**
- Level 1: COMPLETE (24 arsenal weapons)
- Level 2: COMPLETE (34 arsenal weapons + 5 quiz corrections)
- Level 3: IN PROGRESS (L3-Words 13-29 = 17 weapons captured)
- **Total arsenal: 83 entries**
- 3 pronunciation drills created
- 5 pronunciation patterns operational
- 6 teaching dimensions active (etymology double-anchor added)

## Quick Commands for Atlas

**Analyze new word:**
```
Atlas, break down pronunciation for: [word]
```
Uses: `frameworks/word-analysis-protocol.md`

**Create custom drill:**
```
Atlas, create drill using: [word1, word2, word3]
```
Uses: `drills/drill-generator-protocol.md`

**Practice session:**
```
Atlas, vocabulary drill session
```
Loads: Random 5-7 arsenal words → Generates practitioner sentence

**Teach word family:**
```
Atlas, teach me the [prefix/suffix] family
```
Shows: All related words + shared pattern

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Stress-timing principle understood (punch stressed syllable)
- [ ] Pattern recognition active (see omni-, -ant, etc automatically)
- [ ] Drills feel natural (rhythm emerges, not forced)
- [ ] Word families connected (one word → 10+ related)
- [ ] Arsenal growing (vocab.md updated after sessions)
- [ ] Pronunciation confidence (Sid's test: "I feel confident when I read with PUNCH")

## Elster Method: Progressive Learning

**Level 1** (Words 1-50): Foundation patterns
**Level 2** (Words 51-100): Complex combinations
**Level 3** (Words 101-150): Mastery & nuance

**After each 50-word milestone:**
- New drill created celebrating progress
- Pattern consolidation session
- Word family review

## Why This Works

**Verbal Advantage quote on VERBIAGE:**
> "When you shed those unwanted words, you feel better and look better"

**This applies to pronunciation too:**
- Shed the Hindi stress-timing → Feel better (confident)
- Adopt American stress-timing → Look better (natural accent)
- Pattern recognition → Unlock infinite vocabulary without memorization

**Sid's realization (Day 53):**
> "With you - we have the perfect learning and education system!"

The skill works because:
1. **Master key first** (stress-timing) not isolated vowel rules
2. **Pattern recognition** unlocks families not isolated words
3. **Practitioner context** makes it relevant (demos, ARR, VCs)
4. **Drill-based** builds muscle memory through repetition
5. **Encouraging voice** builds confidence not intimidation
