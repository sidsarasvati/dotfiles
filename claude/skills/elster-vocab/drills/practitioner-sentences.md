## Drill #1: The Practitioner

**Words:** OMNIPOTENT, MANIFOLD, PLIANT, RETORT, OBSTINATE

**Created:** Day 53 (Nov 4, 2025)

**Natural reading:**
"Omnipotent VCs with their manifold demands made a pliant founder retort with obstinate truth."

**Read WITH stress (PUNCH bold):**
"ahm-**NIP**-uh-tint VCs with their **MAN**-i-fohld demands made a **PLY**-int founder ri-**TORT** with **AHB**-sti-nit truth."

**Rhythm pattern:**
"**PUNCH**-ta-ta VCs with their **PUNCH**-ta-ta demands made a **PUNCH**-int founder ta-**PUNCH** with **PUNCH**-ta-ta truth."

**What it teaches:**
- Stress-timed rhythm (THE master key applied)
- All 5 words in practitioner context

- Confidence through rhythm discovery

**Sid's breakthrough (Day 53):**
> "What an incredible drill! Reading this, man I feel so confident. I can really find the rhythm! With you - we have the perfect learning and education system!"

**Patterns demonstrated:**
- omni- prefix (OMNIPOTENT)
- -ant/-ate/-ent suffix → -int/-it (PLIANT, OBSTINATE)
- re- prefix reduction (RETORT)
- Stress-timing across multiple words

**Practice notes:**
- PUNCH each stressed syllable HARD
